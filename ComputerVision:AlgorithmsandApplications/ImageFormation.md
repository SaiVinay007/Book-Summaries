# Image formation

* Few forms of image formation process : perspective projection, light scattering when hit a surface, lens optics, bayer color filter array

##### 2.1 Geometric primitives and transformations
Introduction to basic 2D and 3D primitives used like points, lines, planes. How 3D feature are projected into 2D.


Homogeneous coordinates (or projective coordinates) and inhomogeneous coordinates.

Line of infinity :  The points at infinity formed by the intersection of system parallel lines combined is called line of infinity .
The points on the line of infinity are called points of infinity.

Consider two parallel planes : z = 0 ; Z = 1
The z = 1 plane is called reference plane or cartesian plane. Lines in 3D are drawn passing through origin.
For every line not parallel to z = 0 plane, it intesects at a unique point in the cartesian plane and for every system of parallel lines in cartesian plane,
there exists a unique line parallel to plane z=0 in plane z=0.

Therefore, the points in the projective plane corresponds to lines through the origin.

Using the above concept we can represent a 2D point into a Homogeneous coordinate by adding z to the vector(2D representation) S.T the obtained 3D point
lies on the line passing through origin and the 2D point's projection on z=1 plane.


**2D transformations**:
1. Translation: 
2. Rotation:
3. Scaled Rotation:
