# the ubiquitious projective geometry 

* projection preserves straightness
* projection of plane maybe defined as the mapping of points which preserves straight lines
* There is nothing very mysterious about projective space â€“ it is just an extension of Euclidean space in which two lines always
  meet in a point, though sometimes at mysterious points at infinity. [projective space = Euclidean space + points at infinity where parallel lines meet]
